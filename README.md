# Temporal

Temporal is a web app that aims to help users remember every useful thing they have read on the internet.
Users just have to provide the URL to the article and Temporal magically handles the rest.
It indexes the content of the article, generates vector embeddings and ensures that users have access to all of their articles at their fingertips.

### Save articles from the web ‚ö°Ô∏è

Temporal ensures saving articles is as frictionless as possible.
It indexes the contents of the given website and uses machine learning to generate a vector embedding for the document which is used for searching across all your articles.

### Search for whatever you're looking for üîé

As you continue using Temporal to save articles, you can easily search for anything you need.
Temporal uses semantic search to find articles that most closely match your query.
This enables you to search for an idea instead of any specific phrase and get relevant results.

It's not possible to remember exact phrases from every article, especially as time passes.
With Temporal, you don't have to.
Semantic search makes it possible to find the information you need even if you‚Äôve forgotten where exactly it was that you saw it.

### Find similar articles ‚ú®

When you search or save articles on Temporal, you can also find articles on similar topics in your library.
Temporal does this by creating vector embeddings of your content so that it can compare how similar different things are.

## Build with Linode Hackathon

Temporal was built as a submission for the Build with Linode Hackathon organised by [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)
